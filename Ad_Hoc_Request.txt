1. Provide the list of markets in which customer "Atliq Exclusive"
 operates its business in the APAC region.


Ans - > 

 For this we have to check on dim_customer table ,where region is APAC,
and distinct market(Markets can be repeated), so we can get better analysis that
in which market of APAC our business are distributing the products

SELECT 
	DISTINCT(market) 
FROM dim_customer
where region='APAC'


2. What is the percentage of unique product increase in 2021 vs. 2020? The
final output contains these fields,
unique_products_2020
unique_products_2021
percentage_chg

Ans - > For this , I have created two CTE(Common Table Expression) in one column,
through we can get better and understandable , instead of write all in one ,
Here we have added two CTE for different year and then their percentage difference change,
so that we can get idea how much its growth is increasing from 2020 to 2021

with uniqueproducts_2020 as
(
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS unique_products_2020  FROM fact_gross_price
 where fiscal_year = 2020
)

, uniqueproducts_2021 as
(
 SELECT COUNT(*) AS  unique_products_2021 FROM fact_gross_price
 where fiscal_year = 2021 
)



SELECT 
	*,CONCAT(ROUND(((unique_products_2021-unique_products_2020)
		/unique_products_2020)*100,2),'%') AS percentage_chg
FROM 
 uniqueproducts_2020 
 ,uniqueproducts_2021


3.
 Provide a report with all the unique product counts for each segment and
sort them in descending order of product counts. The final output contains
	2 fields,
	segment
	product_count

Answ - >

We want unique product count for each segment for each peripheral(devices),
were we are distributing

SELECT 
	segment,count(product) AS 'product_count' 
from dim_product
